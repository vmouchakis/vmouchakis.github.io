I am a Data Scientist focused on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and building effective ML models. I enjoy using AI to create practical solutions for challenging problems.

My experience includes working with large language models, speech-to-text conversion, and fine-tuning models. I hold an MSc in Data Science from NCSR “Demokritos,” where my thesis research focused on Deep Metric Learning for Music Information Retrieval.

A comprehensive record of my professional experience and qualifications can be found in my [CV](https://vmouchakis.github.io/files/CV-Mouchakis.pdf).
